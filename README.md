For my animation project, I decided to make a peaceful campfire scene. 

Character Creation: 

 I used a character model I made in MakeHuman 

Character Rigging: 

Imported MakeHuman character into Blender and Rigged it there. 



Animation Clip Creation: 

All character animations were created by me using Blender. 

Walking:

Running:

Unity Import: 

The character has been fully moved to Unity with all its materials. 

 

ASM: 

I have created 4 ASMs that correctly connect to one another. 

 

Blend Trees: 

 

Meta Channels: 

Meta Channels have been added to the walking/running, sitting and sitidle animations of the character.

Ragdoll: 

Ragdoll has been fully implemented to activate when collision occurs with fire in the scene. I have also added a small explosive effect for when it triggers. 

 

MISC Features: 

I added some smaller features to the scene. I set up some Inverse Kinematics from within Unity that allows the players' feet to adjust to the terrain. This was very useful as I have a very “hilly” scene, and the ground is very uneven at most points. The script allows me to change the strength of the IK to tailor it as much as I need to.

I used this project as a good way to practice particle effects and lighting as I will be using them heavily for my final project. The fire animation is not my own, however I did change it around to make it better with the scene.
